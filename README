# anti-malware
Signature-based anti-malware trainer and detector

Usage: av-train <malware directory> <benign directory> <output signature file>
    -malware directory: the directory containing the set of malware binaries used to create signatures
    -benign directory: the directory containing the set of safe binaries used to create signatures
    -output signature file: the ouput file containing newly created malware signatures (one per line)

Usage: av-detect <input signature file> [unknown binaries...]
    -input signature file: the file containg known malware signatures (one per line)
    -unkown binaries: an arbitrary number of binaries to be cross-referenced against the given signatures
    
    -output: "binary_name: SAFE" if the binary did not match any given signatures
    -output: "binary_name: MALWARE" if the binary matched a given signature
